# Empty States Are Intentional — v1.1

## Description
This protocol states that, within the Frontend Product Layer, any absence of data must be intentionally designed and communicated to the user.

## Problem it solves
It prevents confusion, perceived system failure, and abandonment caused by blank or undefined interface states.

## Rule
Any interface state where no data is available MUST present an intentional empty state. Blank or undefined states are non-compliant.

## Operational definition

- **Empty state:**
	A user-visible interface condition where no data, results, or content is available to display.

- **Intentional design:**
	A deliberate interface representation that clearly communicates the absence of data and provides context explaining why no data is available.
	Guidance or next steps are required when a user action can resolve the empty state.

- **Blank state:**
	An interface condition where no information, feedback, or structure is presented, leaving the user without context.

- **First-time experience:**
	Any interface state where the user has not previously interacted with the component or flow and no data exists yet as a result.

## Practical application

If a list has no items, the interface must explain why (e.g., no results, no data yet, filters applied) and provide guidance or next steps when applicable.
If a user is in a first-time experience, the interface must guide onboarding or initial action.
If a search returns no results, the system must communicate the outcome and suggest alternatives or corrections.

## Notes

- This protocol applies only within the Frontend Product Layer as defined in the Janus architecture.
- This protocol applies to visual interfaces with human end-users.
- Empty states must provide meaning, not just absence.
- This protocol does not apply to interfaces where an empty state is the intended initial condition, such as blank canvases, new documents, or intentionally open workspaces.
- This protocol complements:
	- Loading States Are Visible
	- Error States Are Actionable
