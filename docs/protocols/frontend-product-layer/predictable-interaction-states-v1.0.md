# Predictable Interaction States — v1.0

## Description


This protocol states that, within the Frontend Product Layer, every user interaction must present clear and predictable state feedback so the user can understand what is happening before, during, and after an action.

## Problem it solves

It prevents silent actions, confusing transitions, duplicated submissions, uncertain loading behavior, and user hesitation caused by missing or inconsistent feedback.

## Rule

Every user-triggered action that modifies data, navigation, or interface state must expose at least one explicit state transition. Absence of any state feedback is non-compliant.

## Operational definition

 - A meaningful action is any action that modifies data, triggers navigation, or produces a system-side effect visible to the user.  
 - Every meaningful action must expose at least one explicit state (for example: loading, success, error, or disabled).

## Constraints

## Practical application

A submit button should show a loading or disabled state while processing. A failed action should return visible error feedback. A successful action should confirm completion or clearly move the user to the next expected state. Interactive elements should not appear clickable when unavailable and should not remain visually unchanged during processing.

## Notes

 - This protocol applies only within the Frontend Product Layer as defined in the Janus architecture.  
 - This protocol applies to visual interfaces with human end-users. Non-visual or system-to-system interactions are out of scope.  
 - Predictability is validated through human review of the interaction path, not by implementation detail alone.  
 - This protocol complements "User Surface First" and "Clarity Over Cleverness" by making interaction outcomes explicit and trustworthy.
