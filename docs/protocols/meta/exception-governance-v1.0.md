# Exception Governance — v1.0

## Description
This protocol defines how and when deviations from existing protocols are allowed within the Janus system, ensuring that flexibility does not compromise system integrity.

## Problem it solves
Protocols enforce consistency, but real-world scenarios require exceptions.
Without governance, exceptions become arbitrary and break system coherence.

## Rule
No protocol may be violated silently.
Any exception MUST be explicitly declared, justified, and traceable.

## Operational definition

- **Exception:**
	A deliberate and explicit deviation from a protocol rule.

- **Justification:**
	A clear explanation of why the protocol cannot be followed in a specific context.

- **Scope:**
	The exact boundary where the exception applies (feature, surface, component, etc.).

- **Traceability:**
	The ability to identify when, where, and why the exception was introduced.

## Exception requirements

An exception MUST include:

1. The protocol being overridden
2. The specific rule being violated
3. The justification
4. The scope of application
5. The expected duration (temporary or permanent)

Temporary exceptions MUST declare an expiration condition — a date, milestone, or event after which the exception is reviewed. Temporary exceptions without expiration condition are treated as permanent.

## Constraints

- Exceptions MUST be minimal in scope
- Exceptions MUST NOT redefine the protocol itself

Two or more exceptions to the same protocol rule within a single release cycle MUST trigger a formal protocol review.
An exception is minimal when it applies to the smallest identifiable surface, component, or interaction that requires the deviation. Exceptions scoped to entire layers or products require human approval and RFC.

- Repeated exceptions indicate a protocol design issue and MUST trigger protocol review

## Practical application

If a UI element requires showing advanced data upfront due to critical operational needs, this may override Progressive Disclosure, but must be documented as an exception.
If a system requires exposing technical identifiers for debugging, this may override Clarity Over Cleverness, but must be justified and scoped.

## Notes

- This protocol applies across all layers of the Janus system
- Exception Governance complements all protocols but does not replace them
- This protocol enables controlled flexibility without breaking determinism
